# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans. It combines "Artificial" (man-made) and "Intelligence" (thinking power) to create systems capable of performing tasks requiring human-like cognition.

## Definition:
"AI is a branch of computer science that enables the creation of intelligent machines capable of behaving, thinking, and making decisions like humans."

## Goals of AI:
1. Replicate human intelligence.
2. Solve knowledge-intensive tasks.
3. Connect perception and action intelligently.
4. Build machines capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence, such as:
   - Proving theorems.
   - Playing chess.
   - Planning surgical operations.
   - Driving cars in traffic.
5. Create systems that can:
   - Exhibit intelligent behavior.
   - Learn new things independently.
   - Demonstrate, explain, and advise users.
